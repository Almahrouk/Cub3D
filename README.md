# cub3D

## Description
This project is a 3D game engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, implemented using raycasting techniques. Players navigate a 2D map in a 3D perspective while interacting with walls, textures, and other game elements.

## Instructions
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo_url>
cd <project_folder>

# Compile the project
make

# Run the project
./cub3D ./maps/your_map.cub

# Features
1. Raycasting engine with textured walls
2 .Player movement with collision detection
3. Map parsing from .cub files
4. Color and texture validation
5. Smooth gameplay with FPS display

#Technical Choices
C language: for low-level control and memory management
MLX42: for window management and graphics
Makefile: for build automation

# Resources
Raycasting Tutorial

# AI Assistance
ChatGPT / GPT-5-mini: helped debug logic for map parsing.
Assisted in writing snippets for memory-safe string handling and parsing functions.
Suggested optimizations for game loop and collision detection.
